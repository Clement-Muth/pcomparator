      summary: Delete a user price.
      description: This operation allows the specified user to delete a specific price
        entry they previously added. When executed, the request removes the
        selected price entry from the database, ensuring it no longer appears in
        search results or in the user's list of contributed prices. This action
        is permanent and requires user authentication to confirm their identity.
        The operation enhances data control by enabling users to manage and
        curate their submitted pricing information.
